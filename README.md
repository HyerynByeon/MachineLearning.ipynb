Title of the Project:
Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Neural Networks

Objective:
To predict the future closing prices of Google's stock (GOOG) using historical stock price data, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to capture and model the temporal dependencies in the data.

Algorithms and Techniques Used:
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network
Data Preprocessing with MinMaxScaler
Feature Engineering (Year, Month, Day extraction)
Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss Function
Adam Optimizer
